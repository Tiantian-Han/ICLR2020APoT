# ICLR2020APoT

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Pytorch 1.1.0 with CUDA

### Dataset Preparation

Please prepare the ImageNet validation dataset, we use [official example code](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/imagenet/main.py) here to provide validation dataloader. The CIFAR10 validation dataset can be download automatically. 

## CIFAR10

change to the CIFAR10 directory first, and then  

```bash
python test.py --bit 5 
```

Then, you will get the output like this:

```bash

We provide 5-bit, 3-bit and 2-bit quantized ResNet-20 here, `--bit 5` can be set to 3 and 2.

## ImageNet

We provide 5-bit quantized and 3-bit quantized ResNet-18 here, they can be downloaded in [this link](https://gofile.io/?c=GkchRp), then put them into the checkpoint folder in ImageNet. 

To start validation, change to the ImageNet directory and then: 

```bash
python test.py --bit 3 
```

Then, you can get the output like this:

We only provide several models to show the implementation.

All the reported models in the paper and the training codes will be open sourced upon acceptance.
